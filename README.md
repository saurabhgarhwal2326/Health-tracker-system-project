*For more detailed information about the project, please refer to the project documentation file (Project Documentation - Python Health Tracker.pdf).*

The Python Health Tracker is a python program designed to assist users in monitoring their health status during the Covid-19 pandemic. It offers functionalities such as tracking body temperature, providing pandemic updates, locating nearby hospitals, and visualizing health data through graphical analysis.

### Dependencies:

- **colorama**: A Python package for adding color and style to terminal output.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **mysql-connector**: A Python driver for MySQL databases that enables Python programs to access MySQL database servers.
- **selenium**: A web scraping and automation tool used to gather information from websites.
- **sys**: A built-in Python module providing access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter.
- **time**: A module providing various time-related functions.

### Functionality:

- **Pandemic Updates**: Retrieve real-time Covid-19 statistics worldwide, ensuring users have accurate information about the current situation.
- **Health Monitoring**: Track user health status by recording body temperature readings. These readings can help in identifying potential Covid-19 infections.
- **Hospital Finder**: Locate hospitals near the user's location for easy access to healthcare facilities in case of emergencies or medical assistance needs.
- **Graphical Analysis**: Visualize temperature records over time through graphical analysis, allowing users to monitor trends and patterns in their health data.

### How to Use:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies listed above using `pip install`.
3. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
4. Run the script using `python Health_Tracker.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to input necessary details such as name, age, gender, address, and country.
6. Explore different functionalities of the Health Tracker such as entering body temperature, accessing pandemic updates, finding hospitals, and viewing graphical analysis of health data.

### Note:

- This project was developed as a 12th-grade school project during the Covid-19 pandemic.
- Some functionalities such as web scraping (hospital finder) require an active internet connection.
- Ensure proper configuration of chromedriver for web scraping tasks.
